# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This pre-work project was completed to achieve the following: 

- To produce a reference guide that I can refer and add to as I learn more throughout the bootcamp.
- To learn about HTML, CSS, GitHub and JavaScript and to begin to develop skills as a web developer.
- It will allow me to quickly lookup my notes, to revise and keep learning/practicing these new skills.
- I learnt how to compose a basic HTML index file, a stylesheet.css, a script.js and how to add them to the html file to be accessed by the browser.  I learnt how to interact with GitHub to create new branches, to add new content and to then add, commit, pull, push and merge the changes to the main branch.
