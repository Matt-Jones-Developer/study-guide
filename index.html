                <h2>HTML</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <code>&lt;base&gt;</code> element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
                    <li>The <code>&lt;link>&gt;</code> element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
                    <li>The <code>&lt;meta>&gt;</code> element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
                    <li>The <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
                    <li>The <code>&lt;head>&gt;</code> element contains information about the webpage.</li>
                    <li>The <code>&lt;body>&gt;</code> element represents the visible content shown to the user.
                        The body tag is a semantic, parent element, whereas a non-semantic, child element is, for example <code><div></div></code>.</li>
                    <li>The <code>&lt;h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6&gt;</code> elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
                    <li>The <code>&lt;ul ol li&gt;</code> elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
                    <li>The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The <img> element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.<br>
                        * The `src` attribute defines the location, or source, of the image file.<br>
                        * The `alt` attribute contains a text string that describes the appearance and functionality of the image.</li>
                    <li>The <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
                    <li>The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
                    <li>The <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> elements are semantic elements that define a section in a document that contains thematic content.</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="card" id="css-section">
                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply: like (.div).</li>
                    <li>Combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
                    <li>A wild card symbol, or *. Declares that ALL of the elements on the page will have the same style properties.</li>
                    <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
                    <li>Padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
                    <li>Properties 'margin-left and margin-right: auto' allows to automatically centre the image regardless of screen width.</li>
                    <li>The text-align property is one way to center a title or heading on a webpage.</li>
                    <li>Add our stylesheet to the html via: <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="./assets/style.css"&gt;</code> tags.</li>
                    <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
                    <li>The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by commas. 
                        A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
                  </ul>

              <section class="card" id="git-section">
                <h2>Git</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>To start interacting with GitHUb, cd into the appropriate folders:<br>
                        cd bootcamp and cd prework-study-guide, then in VSCode, type 'code .' to access the workspace.</li>
                    <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
                    <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
                    <li>TIP: use git status again, to ensure which branch we are now in!</li>
                    <li>git add -A: Stages file changes to be committed.</li>
                    <li>git commit -m "update commit comment here: explain changes" to commit your new updates to the code.</li>
                    <li>git pull origin main: It is a good habit to always pull the base branch into your feature branch before pushing up any code.</li>
                    <li>git push: to transfer all the changes to github. i.e: git push origin feature/add-html</li>
                    <li>Within GitHub: view repo -> should see the new html file.</li>
                    <li>Make it LIVE: settings -> Pages (under environment) Select 'None' and choose MAIN -> Save.</li>
                    <li>Eventually the changes will update and you can view the new live page by selecting 'view website'.</li>
                    <li>To abort use git merge --abort</li><br>
                    <li>Rule 1 - Always rebase when pulling changes from origin/develop onto your local develop.<br>
                        use git pull --rebase.  Why? because if you are pulling from the origin and you have not made any changes to your local develop, 
                        then git pull and git pull --rebase are the same. If you have made a few changes to your local develop that have not been pushed yet.<br>
                        Also, you want to pull any changes you are missing from your origin to your local develop before you can push. 
                        A regular git pull without rebase option may result in merge issues.</li>
                    <li>git merge: Rule 2 - Merge when finishing a feature branch merge change back to develop.
                        Use the following command, when you have made changes and want to merge changes back to develop.
                        If fatal: No remote for the current branch. ... panic!</li>
                    <li>In GitHUb: navigate to prework-study-guide -> click on pull request -> add new title and a comment, click Create Pull Request.</li>
                    <li><strikethrough>Lastly:</strikethrough> merge the branches: click 'Merge pull request' button.</li>
                    <li>Lastly! git checkout main (switch to main branch) I then receive an notice: Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 5 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
                        (use "git pull" to update your local branch) and so we use git pull. Fast forwards. All done!</li>

                <h2>JavaScript</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript is an exciting top-level language that adds both beautiful and functional elements to any webpage.</li> 
                    <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
                    <li>Commenting in JavaScript: // singleline, /* */ for multiple lines.</li>
                    <li>Logging to console (printing statements) via console.log()</li>
                    <li>Operators: + - * / for basic maths, = equals === equality comparision,! (not) and !== (does not equal).</li>
                    <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
                    <li>There are 5 data types: String, Numeric, Boolean, Array and Object.</li>
                    <li>String = text, Numerical = numbers, Boolean = True/False, Array = list of multiple/mixed datatypes, and Object = a declared object such as let myVar = document.querySelector('h1');.</li>
                    <li>Conditional statements: (if/else, if/else if/else) determine if something is true or not, if so run some code, else run different code.</li>
                    <li>For loops: uses indices to perform a task on all items in an array using a loop. Use array's name and it's length to achieve this. Looping through an array is called 'iteration'.</li>
                    <li>Functions: Two types, Built-Ins and user created. Built-ins include event handlers such as alert, querySelector and addEventListener.</li>
                    <li>User create funcions are useful for declaring a block of code and then being able to 'call' (execute) it at any given time in the control flow, or not at all.</li>
